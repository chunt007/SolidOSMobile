Project timeline

1. Framework Migration for Native Applications
Due to incapability issues of between frameworks and mobile application environments that utilize native support, an official framework has not been chosen.
React and React Native have different requirements and are designed for slightly different purposes. There are ways to use Polyfill techniques to force
compatibility.

3. Outdated libraries and depreciated command lines. 
In the process of creating a truly seamless mobile experience, there have been several issues such as tutorials both old and new.
certain commands and where to initate those commands in said directories can not always be held as the programming gospal.

3. Authentication issues
*TBC

4. Progress
There will be at least one pull request per day regarding this application. Thanks to innovations in ChatGPT and widespread use of various libraries in the Github community.
Ideas for code fixability and revision are necessary.
