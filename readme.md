Welcome to SolidOS for mobile

Project timeline


1. Outdated libraries and depreciated command lines. 
In the process of creating a truly seamless mobile experience, there have been several issues such as tutorials both old and new.
certain commands and where to initate those commands in said directories can not always be held as the programming gospal.

2. Progress
I am aiming to make this experience dependent as few libarires as possible.
